* Summary: 
*   This program is to take a basic number from a user and display it back in a complete sentence and in a neat way. 
*    
*    Estimated:  1.5 hrs   
*    Actual:     0.0 hrs
*      The most difficult part was thinking in my head how far apart everything was going to be. I don't have graph paper on me so I had to do it mentally. After some strain, however, I was able to figure it out.
